# Styles-Conference-Tutorial
This repo contains regurgitated HTML and CSS pages from Shay Howe's
tutorial website which can be found at : 

http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

The following documents were reproduced from Shay's tutorial and it covers
a vast amount of foundational material in both HTML and CSS that
I had found to be extremely thorough and educational. This is based
on my experience from having gone through Code Academy's tutorials
and W3School's reference lists. I highly recommend this resource and
I would like to thank Hack Reactor for suggesting this tutorial in their
pre-curriculum.
